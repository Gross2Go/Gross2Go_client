## SCSS Usage

SCSS is used for styling in this project. To utilize SCSS in your components, follow these steps:

1. Create a new SCSS file for your component or page, for example, `MyComponent.scss`.

2. Import the SCSS file into your component or page TypeScript file, for example, `MyComponent.tsx`:

    ```typescript
    import './MyComponent.scss';
    ```

3. Write your styles in the SCSS file using SCSS syntax.

4. Use the styles in your component's JSX code as usual.

## Visual Studio Code Extensions

For live compilation of SCSS files in Visual Studio Code, we recommend installing the following extensions:

1. [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass): Automatically compiles SCSS files and supports live compilation.
2. [Watch SASS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andys8.watch-sass): Watches SCSS files and compiles them automatically on changes.
3. [Sass](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Syler.sass-indented): Compiles SCSS and Sass files quickly and supports features like debugging and code completion.

These extensions will help you work with SCSS files more efficiently in your project.
